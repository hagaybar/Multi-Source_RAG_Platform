# RAG‚ÄëPipeline Prototype

A **local‚Äëfirst Retrieval‚ÄëAugmented‚ÄëGeneration platform** for turning mixed organisational content (PDFs, office docs, presentations, emails, images, websites, etc.) into an interactive knowledge base.  
Built for librarians, researchers and other knowledge‚Äëworkers who need reliable answers from their in‚Äëhouse documentation without sending private data to external services.

## üöÄ Quick¬†Start

```bash
# 1. Clone & install
git clone https://github.com/your‚Äëorg/rag‚Äëpipeline.git
cd rag‚Äëpipeline
poetry install          # or: pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Launch Streamlit UI
poetry run streamlit run app/ui_streamlit.py   # default browser opens

# 3. Create a new project in the UI, upload some PDFs, and ask a question!
```

> **Tip:** Prefer local embeddings? Select **bge‚Äëlarge‚Äëen** under *Settings ‚Üí Embeddings* before indexing.

## üíª UI Usage

The Streamlit UI provides a user-friendly interface for managing RAG-GP projects.

### Creating a New Project

1.  Navigate to the "Projects" section in the sidebar.
2.  Fill out the "Create New Project" form:
    *   **Project Name:** A unique name for your project.
    *   **Project Description:** An optional description of your project.
    *   **Language:** The primary language of your documents.
    *   **Enable Image Enrichment:** Check this box to enable image analysis features.
    *   **Embedding Model:** Select the embedding model to use for your project.
3.  Click the "Create Project" button.

### Managing a Project

Once you have created a project, you can manage it from the "Projects" section.

*   **Select a Project:** Choose a project from the dropdown menu to view its details.
*   **Configuration Editor:** The `config.yml` file for the selected project is displayed in a text editor. You can make changes to the configuration and save them by clicking the "Save Config" button.
*   **Upload Raw Data:** You can upload raw data files (e.g., .pdf, .docx, .txt) to your project using the file uploader. The files will be saved to the appropriate subdirectory under `data/projects/<project_name>/input/raw/`.
*   **Raw File Repository:** The "Raw File Repository" section displays a list of all the raw data files in your project, grouped by file type.
