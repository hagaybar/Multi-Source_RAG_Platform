Primo is capable of exporting files in BibTex format. In the Primo export process the output BibTex file can include comma characters in the ‘Keywords’ field. For example, see BibTex export of a local record (local MMS ID: 990019682990204146) @book{CorryLeo2004DHat, series = {Archimedes (Dordrecht, Netherlands) ; v. 10, 2004}, publisher = {Kluwer Academic Publishers}, isbn = {140202777X}, year = {2004}, title = {David Hilbert and the axiomatization of physics (1898-1918) : from Grundlagen der Geometrie to Grundlagen der Physik}, language = {eng}, address = {Dordrecht}, author = {Corry, Leo}, keywords = {Hilbert, David, 1862-1943; Mathematicians -- Biography; מתמטיקאים -- ביוגרפיה}, } The comma character is the default value for a separator in the ‘Keywords’ field, see Bib(La)Tex documentation here: http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex/doc/biblatex.pdf keywords field (separated values) A separated list of keywords. These keywords are intended for the bibliography filters (see §§ 3.8.2 and 3.14.4), they are usually not printed. Note that with the default separator (comma), spaces around the separator are ignored. The result of the unwanted comma characters in this field is adding unwanted separators. This error leads to further data errors once Primo exported BibTex files are used as input files for additional systems (such as CRIS systems). We do not have access to the BibTex files export mechanism, but it seems that in the BibTex files creation, the keywords field is populated based on values coming from the PNX display/subject or search/subject fields. For example, see the display/subject field of the above record: <subject>Hilbert, David, 1862-1943; Mathematicians -- Biography; מתמטיקאים -- ביוגרפיה</subject> In light of the above, please replace comma characters to spaces (or other characters) in the BibTex keywords field. Just a quick reminder that all timesheets must be submitted by Friday at the end of business day. Please take the time to carefully review your entries to ensure all hours worked, project codes, and client billing information are accurate and complete before submission. Late or incomplete timesheets can delay payroll processing and affect your pay schedule, so timely submission is crucial for everyone. If you encounter any technical difficulties with the timesheet system, have questions about proper coding procedures, or need clarification on billable versus non-billable hours, please don't hesitate to reach out to the HR department immediately. Our team is available to assist you and ensure your timesheet is processed correctly. We truly appreciate your cooperation and commitment to meeting these important deadlines consistently.	406	"{""source_filepath"": ""data\\projects\\ingest_test\\input\\raw\\BibTex export includes unwanted commas in.docx"", ""doc_type"": ""docx"", ""source"": ""data\\projects\\ingest_test\\input\\raw\\BibTex export includes unwanted commas in.docx"", ""content_type"": ""docx"", ""doc_id"": ""data\\projects\\ingest_test\\input\\raw\\BibTex export includes unwanted commas in.docx""}"
