# Assets Folder

The `assets` folder is intended to store static files that may be used by the project. These could include images, templates, or other resources.

- `__init__.py`: This file is empty and is used to mark the `assets` folder as a Python package.

Currently, the folder is empty aside from the `__init__.py` file, but it can be populated with assets as the project evolves.
\n*This description reflects the current minimal state of the folder.*
