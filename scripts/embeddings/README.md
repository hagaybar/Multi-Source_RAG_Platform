# Embeddings Folder

The `scripts/embeddings` folder is designated for scripts and modules related to generating and managing text embeddings. Text embeddings are numerical representations of text that capture semantic meaning, allowing for tasks like similarity search and clustering.

- `__init__.py`: This file is empty and marks the `embeddings` folder as a Python package.

**Purpose and Integration:**
In a typical Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, after documents are ingested and chunked, the text chunks are converted into embeddings using a pre-trained model (e.g., Sentence Transformers, OpenAI embeddings). These embeddings are then stored, often in a vector database, for efficient retrieval.

This folder would house the logic for:
- Loading embedding models.
- Generating embeddings for text chunks.
- Potentially, any utility functions related to embedding management or transformation.

While currently containing only the initializer, this folder will be critical for the "vectorization" stage of the RAG pipeline. The embeddings generated by scripts in this folder would be used by components in the `scripts/index/` and `scripts/retrieval/` folders.
