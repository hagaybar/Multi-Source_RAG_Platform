# Agents Folder

The `scripts/agents` folder is intended to house scripts related to AI agents or agentic functionalities within the project.

- `__init__.py`: This file is empty and marks the `agents` folder as a Python package.

While currently sparse, this folder would be the place to develop and store modules that enable more autonomous or intelligent behaviors within the RAG system, such as agents that can perform multi-step reasoning or interact with external tools.
