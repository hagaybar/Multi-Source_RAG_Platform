# Agents Folder

The `scripts/agents` folder contains helper classes for agent-like behaviour.

- `__init__.py`: Marks the folder as a Python package.
- `base.py`: Provides a minimal `BaseAgent` class that others can extend.
- `image_insight_agent.py`: Generates captions for images and enriches chunk metadata.

These modules are used by the CLI to optionally add additional context during retrieval or indexing stages.
